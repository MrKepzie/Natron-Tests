Hi everybody,


Here is a demo project for Natron V1.0.0.
All 3D images were rendered in Blender using Cycles.

I started the project by downloading these two high quality files :

- This wonderful spaceship created by the talented "KuhnIndustries"
http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/64506

- And the textures used by this model, created by the great "yazjack" 
http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/64610

Thank a lot for your work guys ! Without you, this project would never have existed.


I reworked the rendering just a little bit, because Cycles extracts all passes in PNG 16bpc images sequences.
Even if Natron can handle OpenEXR Multilayer files, the extraction of each pass requires a little extra time.
For people with a medium/slow computer, PNG will be far easier to load.

For the same reason, the projet is rendered in 960x540 resolution to speed-up the rendering process while you'll discover this wonderful piece of software named Natron !


Last part, but not the least ... the whole project is distributed using Creative Common Licence (CC-BY)
You don't know what it is ? Take a look :

So, you can share the projet, change it, tweak it, fork it, destroy it, do whatever you want.
You can also translate this file in any other language or translate the annotation in the project.
The only restriction is to mention the original project and author when you want to put this project online again.

Thank for you attention, and have fun with Natron !



Compositingly yours ... :)
